# Dérive
* A mobile app inspired by the Situationist concept of Dérive, designed to encourage spontaneous exploration by generating random locations and guiding users through urban and natural environments. The app focuses on individual experiences, offering a dynamic, non-social journey through real-time navigation and map integration.
